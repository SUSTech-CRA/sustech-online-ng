Point cloud is a new class of signal that is non-uniform and sparse and this present unique challenges to the signal processing, compression and learning problems. In this talk, we present our multi-scale sparse convolutional learning and Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) based framework for large scale point cloud processing, with applications to the geometry and attributes super-resolution, and dynamic point cloud compression with latent space compensation. The architecture is memory efficient and can learn deep networks to handle large scale point cloud in real world applications. Initial results demonstrated that this framework achieved new state of the art results in geometry super-resolution, attributes deblocking and super-resolving, and dynamic point cloud sequence compression.</p><h2 id="海报链接" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#海报链接"><span>海报链接</span></a></h2><p><img src="https://gtimg.liziwl.cn/post-img/2025-03-14T10-30-00_李竹.jpg" alt=""></p>',8)]))}const c=a(r,[["render",s],["__file","2025-03-14T10-30-00_李竹.html.vue"]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/study/talks/2025-03-14T10-30-00_%E6%9D%8E%E7%AB%B9.html","title":"李竹：多尺度稀疏卷积学习在点云压缩、超分辨率和去块效应中的应用","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"主讲人简介","slug":"主讲人简介","link":"#主讲人简介","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"讲座简介","slug":"讲座简介","link":"#讲座简介","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"海报链接","slug":"海报链接","link":"#海报链接","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1743824818000,"contributors":[{"name":"liziwl","username":"liziwl","email":"leezisy@gmail.com","commits":1,"url":"https://github.com/liziwl"}]},"filePathRelative":"study/talks/2025-03-14T10-30-00_李竹.md"}');export{c as comp,h as data};
